# BloodDonation
blood donation website with flask and MySQL

This project was a ppart of a course for Introduction to biomedical software, in this project i make a flask website and a MySQL database. 
for now the project isn't online.
In this application you can donate a specific type of blood to the clinic, you can request a specific blood type and the amount, and there is a Multiple casulty incident where you can ask for an amount of blood O-.
There is a login form for Admin, Refular user and research student. 
The admin can accses the admin panel, the request form and the donation form. 
The regular user can only accses the donation and requests forms. 
and the research student can accses only the RS panel. 
I have used HTML and CSS to this extent for the very first time.
